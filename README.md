This is a genetic algorithm that uses last years hockey stats to learn how to draft a winning fantasy hockey league team.
The goal of this project is to help me gain insight into how I should be selecting players, and what I should be looking for in those players.

My specific league uses the following point distribution:
Goals       6
Assists     4
Power Play Points   2
Shorthanded Goals   2
Game-Winning Goals  .25
Shots on Goal       0.9
Hits        1
Blocks      0.5

Goalies:
Win         5
Saves       0.3
Shutouts    5

This is how our league determines which player in the league wins and who loses.
My theory is that if I create a mock draft with managers who learn how to weight the different categories using last years stats,
then it will give me insight into whether specific stats are overweighted or underweighted currently how the league weights them.

I also could use the help in my league, as of Nov 8 2023 I have 1 win and 2 losses.
